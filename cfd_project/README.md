# Distributed Pressure Drops: An Axisymmetric Approach

## Overview
This project was developed for the Nuclear Thermal Hydraulics course during the MSc in Nuclear Engineering at the University of Pisa. It focuses on evaluating friction factors in a circular pipe using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). 


## Introduction
The main objective of this work is to compute distributed pressure drops using StarCCM+ and compare the CFD results with classical experimental relationships used in the Moody's Diagram (such as Poiseuille, Blasius, and McAdams). The project analyzes both smooth and rough pipes across laminar and turbulent regimes to identify the parameters that most affect the simulation's accuracy.
