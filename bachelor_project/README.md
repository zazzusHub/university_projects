# Bachelor Projects: Physics Laboratory

## Overview
This repository contains laboratory reports and data analysis scripts from the Physics Bachelor's degree program at the University of Pisa. The projects span two years of laboratory courses, covering a wide range of topics from basic electronics to physics experiments.

## Directory Structure
* `lab_reports/`: Contains almost all the laboratory reports completed during the courses. **Note: These documents are written in Italian.**
* `python_scripts/`: Contains the Python scripts used for data analysis, curve fitting, and post-processing of the experimental data.

## Key Experiments Covered
* **Analog Electronics:** Analysis of simple circuits such as passive filters, Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps), and oscillators.
* **Digital Electronics:** Basic and advanced digital circuit experiments.
* **Modern & Quantum Physics:** Calculation of the electron charge-to-mass ratio ($e/m$), analysis of the photoelectric effect, and Young's double-slit interference experiment.
