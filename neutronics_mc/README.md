# Accident Tolerant Fuels: Neutronic Aspects

## Overview
Project developed for the course Computational Codes for Nuclear Reactors, in the MSc in Nuclear Engineering at the University of Pisa. 
It uses OpenMC, a Monte Carlo transport code, to investigate the neutronic characteristics of Accident Tolerant Fuels (ATFs), comparing a FeCrAl alloy with conventional Zircaloy.
