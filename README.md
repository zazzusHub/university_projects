# University Projects Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my university projects repository! This collection showcases the academic work, laboratory experiments, and computational simulations I completed during my studies at the University of Pisa. 

The repository bridges my background in Physics (Bachelor's degree) with my advanced studies in Nuclear Engineering (Master's degree), demonstrating a solid foundation in both experimental data analysis and complex numerical simulations.

## Repository Structure

### ☢️ Master's Degree Projects (Nuclear Engineering)
* **Accident Tolerant Fuels - Neutronic Aspects**: An investigation into the neutronic characteristics of ATFs (FeCrAl vs. Zircaloy) using Monte Carlo transport simulations (**OpenMC**).
* **Distributed Pressure Drops - An Axisymmetric Approach**: A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study evaluating friction factors in smooth and rough pipes using **StarCCM+**.

### ⚛️ Bachelor's Degree Projects (Physics)
* **Physics Laboratory & Data Analysis**: A comprehensive collection of lab reports and post-processing scripts from a two-year laboratory course. Experiments range from analog and digital electronics (Op-Amps, passive filters) to modern quantum physics (e/m ratio, photoelectric effect, Young's double-slit). 
  * *Note: The official lab reports are written in Italian, while the data analysis is performed using **Python** scripts.*

## Technologies & Tools Highlight
Across the projects in this repository, I have utilized a variety of tools for simulation, data analysis, and documentation:
* **Simulation & CFD:** OpenMC, Siemens StarCCM+
* **Programming & Data Analysis:** Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebooks
* **Formatting & Documentation:** LaTeX, Markdown
